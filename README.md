OneStop is a distributed, scalable, event-driven database and search engine for environmental data.
It is designed to receive metadata both from automated systems and manual uploads of ISO-19115 XML metadata.
It implements generic parsing and analysis of that metadata while also enabling arbitrary processing flows
on it. All metadata entities are retrievable via REST API, exposed as streaming events via Kafka, and
indexed to support a wide range of search and discovery capabilities via Elasticsearch.

It is being developed on a grant by a team of researchers from the University of Colorado (more legal info below).

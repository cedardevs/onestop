  "description": "The National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) is a network of long-term water level staions operated and maintained by CO-OPS. NWLON stations are located on shore-based platforms, and primarily collect real-time water level measurements.  As of January 2013, approximately 180 of 210 NWLON stations also collect real-time meteorological data. About 20 CO-OPS Physical Oceanographic Real-Time Systems (PORTS) comprise a group of water level stations, and 65 of these stations also collect real-time meteorological data. Data parameters include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, air temperature, and water temperature.",

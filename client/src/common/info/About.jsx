              The OneStop Project is designed to improve NOAA's data discovery and access framework. Focusing on all layers
              of the framework and not just the user interface, OneStop is addressing data format and metadata best practices,
              ensuring more data are available through modern web services, working to improve the relevance of dataset searches,
              and advancing both collection-level metadata management and granule-level metadata systems to accommodate the
              wide variety and vast scale of NOAA's data.

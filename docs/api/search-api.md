# The Search API
## Table of Contents
- [Search Requests](search-requests) - What requests can be done on the Search endpoints.
- [Search Query Syntax](search-query-syntax) - In-depth on the ElasticSearch query syntax used by our Search API.

The Search API provides endpoints for OneStop data discovery. Either a POST (with a correctly formatted **JSON request body**) or GET request  will work. All endpoints expect the same request schema format to be used but return data of the type specified from the URL.

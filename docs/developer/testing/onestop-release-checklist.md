# Release Prep Checklist

## Code Verification

- [ ] Update libraries to latest, if possible
- [ ] Ensure that included images are compressed in the git repo

### Automated Code Verification

- [ ] Run `retire -p` on client code [Retire JS](https://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/)
  - This runs as part of the client-checks job in every circle build.
- [ ] Run `gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze --info` to do OWASP security check
  - This runs nightly on the master branch.

## Documentation

- [ ] Review documentation, and that it is still in sync with the project.
- [ ] Confirm supported browser docs: [Supported Browsers](https://github.com/cedardevs/onestop/wiki/OneStop-Client-Supported-Browsers)
- [ ] Update the "as of" date in the supported browser docs.

## Test Environment

1. Deploy the latest master branch code to https://sciapps.colorado.edu (private deployOS playbook)
1. Reset the indices and reload the data. (private loadOnestop playbook)
    - [ ] Check the logs, to make sure when ETL runs, 100% of the collections and granules make it into the search index (or document that those that do not are not expected to)

## Manual UI Checks

During all UI checks, make sure to keep an eye on the dev console for unexpected errors or warnings.

## Browser Support and CSS

- Verify CSS works across supported browsers:
  - note for css on IE (VirtualBox): You may have to manually clear the IE cache.
  - [ ] IE 11 on AdminLan
  - [ ] IE 11 on Windows
  - [ ] Firefox latest on Mac
  - [ ] Firefox latest on AdminLan
  - [ ] Chrome latest on Mac
  - [ ] Chrome latest on AdminLan
  - [ ] Safari
  - [ ] Use Chrome dev mobile view to check rendering on mobile devices, including landscape views
- Test responsiveness by adjusting window size between large and small
  - [ ] Landing page adjusts gracefully
  - [ ] Header and footer elements maintain reasonable placement in page layout
  - [ ] On search page, with all keyword categories expanded, they stay visible (the footer is pushed down without clipping)
  - [ ] Result cards respond to page adjustments
  - [ ] Collection detail view realigns elements cleanly on each tab

## UI Behavior

Follow these steps to confirm that core behavior is working as expected, as well as verify 508 compliance with some quick checks.

- [ ] At least one submap URL is listed. Paste it into the address bar.
- [ ] All the collections loaded are listed. Paste one into the address bar to load the details page, to ensure the sitemap links are formatted correctly.
- [ ] https://sciapps.colorado.edu/onestop-search/docs/openapi.yaml (should auto-download or display the yaml file, depending on browser)

### TBD

#### Data we should identify or add to the test set:

- No time range (in normal fields)
- Hazard image granules (it is in the test set, add it to the checklist)

#### Future Features?

- Paleo date filtering
- Time filtering with different relationships

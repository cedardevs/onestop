# JSON schema validation

The requests to api are validated against a JSON schema.

## Schemas

The larger schema is broken down into [components](/api-search/schema). The build step merges these into a single schema for the code to reference, however some tests validate against specific components directly in order to keep the tests clear. To see the complete schema, check `api-search/build/resources/main/onestop-request-schema.json` after running `./gradlew api-search:build`.

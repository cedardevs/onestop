# Metadata Manager Navigation Guide
As a metadata manager working with a OneStop deployment, you will have one or more different tasks to accomplish with the OneStop system. Perhaps you've loaded your metadata through an external tool that pushes its input downstream to OneStop. On the other hand, you might be directly pushing metadata to OneStop via the Registry API. No matter how your metadata gets into OneStop, however, you'll probably be curious about what you can do to take full advantage of the OneStop search functionality. Whatever your perspective is as someone in charge of a set of metadata that's ultimately ending up in OneStop, you should be able to find relevant documentation here.

Since this role requires interacting with several components of the OneStop ecosystem, you are encouraged to start with the brief architectural overview to get your bearings. The guide then takes you through your three most common goals as a metadata manager: creating metadata, loading and maintaining your metadata, and troubleshooting within the OneStop system.

Please note that for the Metadata Manager documentation, we are assuming that you will use existing tools to integrate your metadata with OneStop and that you will not be responsible for connecting your own software to the underlying components. If you _do_ need information pertaining to connecting your own software with a OneStop deployment, you can find it in the [External Developer Navigation Guide](external-developer.md).

Take a look at our navigational suggestions below and go directly to what you need, or simply click the `Next` link at the bottom of the page to start at the top and work your way down.

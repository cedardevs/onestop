# Public User Navigation Guide
As a public user of OneStop, there are three primary methods to search the data contained within: via the web-based user interface (UI), the RESTful API, and the command line interface (CLI) tool. If you're new to the OneStop ecosystem, you should interact with one or both of the running instances of the UI to get some familiarity with basic search features. Then if you choose to be more of a power user, we encourage you to explore the ins and outs of our API and CLI.

Take a look at our navigational suggestions below, or simply click the `Next` link at the bottom of the page to start at the top and work your way down.

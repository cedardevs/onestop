      versions of zookeeper prior to 3.4.10. We're currently using 3.4.13.

      file name: avro-1.8.2.jar (shaded: com.google.guava:guava:11.0.2)
      This vulnerability refers to an unbounded allocation that can occur during the deserialization of several specific
      classes provided by the Guava library. Howver, the only usage of Guava in this project is as a shaded dependency
      within the avro jar, and only the specific classes in use by avro have been shaded into it. Those shaded dependencies
      include neither AtomicDoubleArray nor CompoundOrdering_CustomFieldSerializer, the two classes containing the
      vulnerability (see the fix implemented later in Guava: https://github.com/google/guava/commit/7ec8718f1e6e2814dabaa4b9f96b6b33a813101c)
      In short, this vulnerability *as flagged due to avro-1.8.2.jar* is not present in this project.

      xzgrep command line tool. That script is not included in this jar, which is used to compress avro messages.

      This vulnerability is marked as only present in Spring Framework 5.0.5.RELEASE. Because we are using Spring Boot
      2.1.4.RELEASE as of this suppression, this corresponds to Spring Framework 5.1.6.RELEASE which does not have this
      vulnerability, and it is coming up as a false positive. See the DependencyCheck GitHub issue comment here:

    <notes><![CDATA[
      These CVE vulnerabilities are all described in relation to Spring Framework versions <= 4. Because the dependency
      triggering these (spring-retry-1.2.4.RELEASE.jar) is coming from 'org.springframework.kafka:spring-kafka' and --
      as of this suppression -- the version of spring-kafka is 2.2.5.RELEASE, we know that the corresponding Spring
      version is 5.1.6.RELEASE. This can be confirmed by reviewing the `build.gradle` file for the 'spring-kafka' project
      under the v.2.2.5 tag. See: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-kafka/blob/v2.2.5.RELEASE/build.gradle

      We are supressing this CVE for two reasons. First, it is triggered by our dependency on 'org.testcontainers:testcontainers:1.10.7'
      which has a subdependency of 'org.apache.commons:commons-compress:1.18'. According to the official CVE description, this
      vulnerability applies to versions 1.7 to 1.17 of commons-compress (specifically using ZipArchiveInputStream). Our
      dependency graph indicates we are using a newer version. Second, this dependency is strictly used for testing and not production
      artifacts.
